                    <p>I am a Ph.D. Research Scholar and a Research Assistant specializing in Computer Vision. I am passionate about learning machine learning algorithms and solving practical challenges in their application to real-world problems.</p>
                    <p>My research concentrates on the use of machine learning (especially Deep Learning) methods for activity recognition from videos. A deep learning architecture is proposed for egocentric video, which integrates both action appearance and motion within a single model. Development and evaluation will be based on publicly available data.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I had the opportunity to collaborate with the Life Sciences and Veterinary Sciences departments at my university on several machine learning projects. This interdisciplinary work involved developing and applying advanced machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in biological and veterinary sciences, enhancing research outcomes and fostering innovation at the intersection of technology and life sciences.</p>
